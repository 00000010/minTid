Plan
The purpose of this file is to document what I want this application to give me.

I want it to be able to answer:
- How am I progressing toward my short-term, medium-term, long-term goals?
- How are my habits progressing? How long have I sustained these habits?
- What have been my most productive days? Why?
- What have been my least productive days? Why?
- What are things I usually do on bad productive days?
- What are things I usually do on good productive day?
- How have my goals changed?
- How much time do I spend on applications?

STATISTICS

General stuff:
- "choose a character that will keep you accountable"
  - I really don't know a better way to word this

Currently working on:
Choose your own character
  - Should be brought up once and if user can choose not to choose (store choice in config file, along with other application settings)

Tasks: things that need to be done
- components: title, description, why, blockers, estimated time
- can be directly worked on
- examples: fold laundry, do exercise part 1A
Habits: things that must be done or not done consistently
- title, description, why, frequency, start date, highest streak, streak, average time
- habits must be broken into tasks to be worked on
  - making a habit will automatically create tasks for you
- cannot be directly worked on
- when these tasks are worked on, time is recorded to get an idea of the average amount of time it takes to do it
  - the idea is that often it is less than expected
- examples: do laundry on Tuesday, exercise, brush teeth
Promises: things you agree to do by a certain time
- is this necessary?
  - until I can remember what this is, it is removed
Goals: things you wish to complete in the long-term (projects, for example)
- title, description, why
- no end date (setting an end date may encourage procrastination; whether or not I meet the end date is irrelevant if I am making continuous progress regardless)
- cannot be directly worked on
- work on it by doing tasks related to it
- examples: earn Security+ certification
- Hourly-based tasks (work on task for x hours, get ax points)
Ideas:
- the most abstract component
- title, description, why
- need to be turned into goals to be concrete
Distractions: things that you find you waste too much time on
- title, description, why is it distracting
- examples: browsing, reading

Focus on the WHY. Why do I want to do this ("have to" is not an option)?

Notes:
Process:
- Config file read
  - Store in struct accessible through getter/setter

TODO:
- Load config
- Resizing
- Fix leaks
- Command mode
  - Autocomplete
- Implement character selection
