Plan
The purpose of this file is to document what I want this application to give me.

I want it to be able to answer:
- How am I progressing toward my short-term, medium-term, long-term goals?
- How are my habits progressing? How long have I sustained these habits?
- What have been my most productive days? Why?
- What have been my least productive days? Why?
- What are things I usually do on bad productive days?
- What are things I usually do on good productive day?
- How have my goals changed?
- How much time do I spend on applications?

General stuff:
- "choose a character that will keep you accountable"
  - I really don't know a better way to word this

Currently working on:
Choose your own character
  - Should be brought up once and if user can choose not to choose (store choice in config file, along with other application settings)

Tasks (things that need to be done), habits (things that must be done or not done consistently), promises (things you agree to do by a certain time), goals (things you wish to complete in the long-term)

Notes:
Process:
- Config file read
  - Store in struct accessible through getter/setter
